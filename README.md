# 🛍️ Retail Sales Analytics & Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Retail Sales Analytics and Forecasting** system built with **Python**.  
It analyzes historical retail sales data, generates **business insights** through KPIs & visualizations, and predicts future sales using **machine learning models**.

The system is fully modular, with separate components for:
- **Data Loading & Cleaning**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Sales Forecasting**
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** for easy execution

It’s designed to mimic a **real-world data analytics pipeline** that could be deployed in retail companies to help with **business decision-making**.

## 🎯 Purpose
Retail businesses often have large volumes of transaction data but **lack actionable insights**.  
This project bridges that gap by:
1. Processing and cleaning raw retail data.
2. Generating **KPIs** (Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Orders).
3. Producing **visual reports** like revenue by region/category.
4. Using **machine learning** to forecast sales for upcoming months.

This is useful for:
- **Business planning**
- **Inventory management**
- **Revenue projection**
- **Data-driven decision making**
